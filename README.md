# Python Practice Repository

Welcome to my Python Practice repository!  
This repo is my **daily Python practice**, where I write code to learn and improve my skills from **basic to advanced concepts**.

## Why This Repo
- To **practice Python daily** and stay consistent.
- To **showcase my coding skills** for internships and job applications.
- To have a **personal reference** for all Python concepts and exercises.

## Repository Structure
- Each day has a folder: `Day1_Basics`, `Day2_DataTypes`, etc.
- Each folder contains Python scripts with **examples and comments** for clarity.
- Scripts are meant for **learning and practice purposes**.

## Goals
- Showcase my coding progress and learning consistency.
- Demonstrate familiarity with Python core concepts and libraries.
- Build a strong foundation for data analysis, web development, and automation projects.

## Notes
- Code is written for **educational purposes** and may include practice exercises.
- Future additions will include **Python libraries and mini-projects** to enhance the repository further.
